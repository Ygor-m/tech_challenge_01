# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project involves building a predictive regression model to estimate medical insurance costs based on various features such as age, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking status, gender, and region. The goal is to create a reliable model that can help insurance companies or individuals understand the factors influencing medical costs.

## Introduction

The project uses a synthetic dataset to simulate real-world medical insurance data. The dataset includes the following features:
- **Age**: The age of the individual.
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.
- **Children**: Number of children covered by the insurance.
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (Yes/No).
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Region**: The region where the individual resides (e.g., northeast, southeast, etc.).
- **Charges**: The medical insurance cost (target variable).

The model is built using Python and employs a linear regression approach to predict the insurance costs. The project also includes statistical validation and visualization of results.
